# warpgate_user (Resource)

Manages a user in WarpGate. Users represent identities that can be authenticated and authorized to access targets. Each user can have different credential policies that determine how they authenticate for different protocols.

  username    = "eugene"
  description = "Eugene - Development Lead"
  
  credential_policy {
    ssh      = ["Password", "PublicKey"]
    http     = ["Password", "Totp"]
    mysql    = ["Password"]
    postgres = ["Password"]
  }
}

resource "warpgate_user" "deploy_bot" {
  username    = "deploy_bot"
  description = "Deployment automation service account"
  
  credential_policy {
    ssh = ["PublicKey"]
